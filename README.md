# Sand RPT: Compare Different Models

Sand RPT: Compare Different Sand Models

This Jupiter Notebook compares different sand models including: stiff sand, soft sand, contact cement, constant cement and the sand model using Rayer-Hunt-Gardner (RHG) equation. 

Note: 
All the .py files are functions that will be called in the Jupiter Notebook: Sand_RPT_Compare_Different_Models.ipynb.

We start with comparing the P-wave velocity vs Porosity for different sand models at Vclay = 0.1 and Vclay = 0, as below.
